## Streaming Platform Project
More recently, streaming platform offerings have been spread out across an increasing number of platforms. Traditionally, a user may have several concurrent subscriptions to ensure theyâ€™re able to watch all of the shows and movies they want. A more cost effective approach would be to subscribe to each service for one month at a time. In this project, I use IMDB ratings and WatchMode data to provide insights into streaming platform offerings so that users might create informed stream service watch schedules.

The code contained in this folder includes merging and cleaning in R and Python.
